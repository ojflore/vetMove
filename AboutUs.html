   <br>Jose Flores:
  <br> <p1 align=left>I am a Veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard where I served for 8 years. I am a senior at Point Park University enrolled in the Information Technology program. As a member of the Coast Guard, I performed many jobs and gained a myriad of experience in leadership, technical, analytical, and problem solving skills. As a programmer, I wanted to create a useful website that can help military members transition from one place to another.</p1>

   <br> Jessica Beitler:
  <br> <p2 align=left> I am a senior IT student here at Point Park where I also play on the softball team. I changed my major from Accounting to IT halfway through my college career and it was a great decision! I have enjoyed learning new technological concepts, working hands on with these concepts, and being part of great projects such as vetMove. Once I am dome with classes this April, I will start working for Magna5 out of Coraopolis as a NOC Engineer and couldn't be more excited.
